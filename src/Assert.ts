/**
 * From Wikipedia
 * In computer programming, [...] an assertion is a predicate connected to a point in the program, that always should evaluate to true at that point in code execution.
 * Assertions can help a programmer read the code, help a compiler compile it, or help the program detect its own defects.
 *
 * In english, an assertion helps express and enforce expectations in scenarios where it is complicated or impossible to represent the system
 * accurately using Typescript.
 *
 * Assertions work by throwing when the expectation is not met, hopefully stopping the program.
 * This follows the fail fast mentality, where you should stop a program as soon as you detect an error, to prevent further errors and state corruption.
 *
 * The methods in this module will throw an {@link AssertionError}, with an `isFatal: true` property so that you can decide to not catch this class of errors, if you want.
